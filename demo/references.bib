	abstract = {The web is an increasingly important medium of expression for both technical and non-technical authors, and the family of web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc) is poised to become the de facto content authoring format across disciplines. For such a future to become possible, the ease with which authors—especially non-technical authors—can express themselves becomes paramount. This work presents a method of reducing the complexity of source-level HTML authoring and shows its experimental impact on usability. Our initial findings suggest a path toward simpler HTML source organization without sacrificing rich, modern design.},

	url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488399},
	abstract = {Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) took a valuable step towards separating web content frompresentation. But HTML pages still contain large amounts of “design scaffolding” needed to hierarchically layer content for proper presentation. This paper presents Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), a CSS-like language for separating this presentational HTML from real content. With CTS, authors use standard CSS selectors to describe how to graft presentational scaffolding onto their pure-content HTML. This improved separation of content from presentation enables even naive authors to incorporate rich layouts (including interactive Javascript) into their own pages simply by linking to a tree sheet and adding some class names to their HTML.},

	abstract = {Examples have been widely used in the area of web design to help web authors create web pages. However, without actually understanding how an example is constructed, people often have trouble extracting the elements they want and incorporating them into their own design. This paper introduces WebCrystal, a web development tool that helps users understand how a web page is built. WebCrystal contributes novel interaction techniques that let the user quickly access HTML and CSS information by selecting questions regarding how a selected element is designed. It provides answers using a textual description and a customized code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted to recreate the desired properties. WebCrystal also supports combining the styles and structures from multiple elements into the generated code snippet, and provides visualizations on the web page itself to explain layout relationships. Our user study shows that WebCrystal helped both novice and experienced developers complete more tasks successfully using significantly less time. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

This paper describes Sifter, a web browser extension that can augment a well-structured web site with advanced filtering and sorting functionality. These added features work inside the site's own pages, preserving the site's presentational style and the user's context. Sifter contains an algorithm that scrapes structured data out of well-structured web pages while usually requiring no user intervention. We tested Sifter on real web sites and real users and found that people could use Sifter to perform sophisticated queries and high-level analyses on sizable data collections on the Web. We propose that web sites can be similarly augmented with other sophisticated data-centric functionality, giving users new benefits over the existing Web.},

	abstract = {Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language that describes two-dimensional vector graphics for storage and distribution on the Web. Unlike raster image formats, SVG-based images scale nicely to arbitrary resolutions and sizes. However, the current SVG standard provides little flexibility for taking into account varying viewing conditions, such as differ- ent screen formats, and there is little support for interactive exploration of a diagram. We introduce an extension to SVG called Constraint Scalable Vector Graphics (CSVG) that permits a more flexible description of figures. With CSVG, an image can contain objects whose positions and other properties are specified in relation to other objects using constraints, rather than being specified in absolute terms. For example, a box can be specified to remain inside another box, without being given an absolute position. The precise layout can then be left to the browser, which can adapt it dynamically to changing viewing conditions on the client side. Further extensions add support for alternate layouts, interaction, and declarative animation. Leveraging well-established methods for linear constraint solving, we implemented a prototype viewer for CSVG by embedding our Cassowary constraint solver into an existing SVG renderer.},

Moreover, the Juno-2 solver is not limited to acyclic constraint systems. Juno-2 also includes a powerful extension language that allows users to define new constraints. The system demonstrates that fast constraint solving is possible with a highly extensible, fully declarative constraint language. The report describes what it is like to use Juno-2, outlines the methods that Juno-2 uses to solve constraints, and discusses its performance.

But over time, large content providers learned to exploit the structure in their data, leveraging databases and server side technologies to provide rich browsing and visualization. Individual authors fall behind once more: neither old-fashioned static pages nor domain-specific publishing frameworks supporting limited customization can match custom database-backed web applications. In this paper, we propose Exhibit, a lightweight framework for publishing structured data on standard web servers that requires no installation, database administration, or programming. Exhibit lets authors with relatively limited skills-those same enthusiasts who could write HTML pages for the early Web-publish richly interactive pages that exploit the structure of their data for better browsing and visualization. Such structured publishing in turn makes that data more useful to all of its consumers: individual readers get more powerful interfaces, mashup creators can more easily repurpose the data, and Semantic Web enthusiasts can feed the data to the nascent Semantic Web.},

We formally define a template, and propose a model that describes how values are encoded into pages using a template. We present an algorithm that takes, as input, a set of template-generated pages, deduces the unknown template used to generate the pages, and extracts, as output, the values encoded in the pages. Experimental evaluation on a large number of real input page collections indicates that our algorithm correctly extracts data in most cases.},

	abstract = {Grid-based page designs are ubiquitous in commercially printed publications, such as newspapers and magazines. Yet, to date, no one has invented a good way to easily and automatically adapt such designs to arbitrarily-sized electronic displays. The difficulty of generalizing grid-based designs explains the generally inferior nature of on-screen layouts when compared to their printed counterparts, and is arguably one of the greatest remaining impediments to creating on-line reading experiences that rival those of ink on paper. In this work, we present a new approach to adaptive grid-based document layout, which attempts to bridge this gap. In our approach, an adaptive layout style is encoded as a set of grid-based templates that know how to adapt to a range of page sizes and other viewing conditions. These templates include various types of layout elements (such as text, figures, etc.) and define, through constraint-based relationships, just how these elements are to be laid out together as a function of both the properties of the content itself, such as a figure's size and aspect ratio, and the properties of the viewing conditions under which the content is being displayed. We describe an XML-based representation for our templates and content, which maintains a clean separation between the two. We also describe the various parts of our research prototype system: a layout engine for formatting the page; a paginator for determining a globally optimal allocation of content amongst the pages, as well as an optimal pairing of templates with content; and a graphical user interface for interactively creating adaptive templates. We also provide numerous examples demonstrating the capabilities of this prototype, including this paper, itself, which has been laid out with our system.},

	abstract = {Interactive behaviors in GUIs are often described in terms of states, transitions, and constraints, where the constraints only hold in certain states. These constraints maintain relationships among objects, control the graphical layout, and link the user interface to an underlying data model. However, no existing Web implementation technology provides direct support for all of these, so the code for maintaining constraints and tracking state may end up spread across multiple languages and libraries. In this paper we describe ConstraintJS, a system that integrates constraints and finite-state machines (FSMs) with Web languages. A key role for the FSMs is to enable and disable constraints based on the interface’s current mode, making it possible to write constraints that sometimes hold. We illustrate that constraints combined with FSMs can be a clearer way of defining many interactive behaviors with a series of examples.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth of asynchronous online conversations thanks to the rise of social media. Analyzing and gaining insights from such conversations can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the discussion becomes very long. A promising solution to this problem is topic modeling, since it may help the user to quickly understand what was discussed in the long conversation and explore the comments of interest. However, the results of topic modeling can be noisy and may not match the users current information needs. To address this problem, we propose a novel topic modeling system for asynchronous conversations that revises the model on the fly based on user's feedback. We then integrate this system with interactive visualization techniques to support the user in exploring long conversations, as well as revising the topic model when the current results are not adequate to fulfill her information needs. An evaluation with real users illustrates the potential benefits of our approach for exploring conversations, when compared to both a traditional interface as well as an interactive visual interface that does not support human-in-the-loop topic model.

A process of distillation is needed to boil down a large information space into information that is concise and organized. We take a system-augmented approach to the problem by creating a set of tools with which human editors can collaboratively distill a large amount of informal information. Two design principles, which we will define as incremental diagenesis and incremental summarization, help editors flexibly distill the informal information. Our system, Arkose, is built as a demonstration of these principles, providing the necessary tools for distillation. These tools include a number of visualization and information retrieval mechanisms, as well as an authoring tool and a navigator for the information space. They support a gradual increase in the order and reusability of the information space and allow various levels of intermediate states of a distillation.},

	abstract = {Although detractors of functional programming sometimes claim that functional programming is too difficult or counter-intuitive for most programmers to understand and use, evidence to the contrary can be found by looking at the popularity of spreadsheets. The spreadsheet paradigm, a first-order subset of the functional programming paradigm, has found wide acceptance among both programmers and end users. Still, there are many limitations with most spreadsheet systems. In this paper, we discuss language features that eliminate several of these limitations without deviating from the first-order, declarative evaluation model. The language used to illustrate these features is a research language called Forms F;3. Using Forms F;3, we show that procedural abstraction, data abstraction and graphics output can be supported in the spreadsheet paradigm. We show that, with the addition of a simple model of time, animated output and GUI I F;O also become viable. To demonstrate generality, we also present an animated Turing machine simulator programmed using these features. Throughout the paper, we combine our discussion of the programming language characteristics with how the language features prototyped in Forms F;3 relate to what is known about human effectiveness in programming.},

	abstract = {Cleaning spreadsheet data types is a common problem faced by millions of spreadsheet users. Data types such as date, time, name, and units are ubiquitous in spreadsheets, and cleaning transformations on these data types involve parsing and pretty printing their string representations. This presents many challenges to users because cleaning such data requires some background knowledge about the data itself and moreover this data is typically non-uniform, unstructured, and ambiguous. Spreadsheet systems and Programming Languages provide some UI-based and programmatic solutions for this problem but they are either insufficient for the user's needs or are beyond their expertise. In this paper, we present a programming by example methodology of cleaning data types that learns the desired transformation from a few input-output examples. We propose a domain specific language with probabilistic semantics that is parameterized with declarative data type definitions. The probabilistic semantics is based on three key aspects: (i) approximate predicate matching, (ii) joint learning of data type interpretation, and (iii) weighted branches. This probabilistic semantics enables the language to handle non-uniform, unstructured, and ambiguous data. We then present a synthesis algorithm that learns the desired program in this language from a set of input-output examples. We have implemented our algorithm as an Excel add-in and present its successful evaluation on 55 benchmark problems obtained from online help forums and Excel product team.},

Meta functions are shareable via URL and instrumented to record runtime data. Combining thousands of Meta functions with their collective runtime data, we demonstrate tools in-cluding an optimizer that replaces your function with a more efficient version written by someone else, an auto-patcher that saves your program from crashing by finding equivalent func-tions in the community, and a proactive linter that warns you when a function fails elsewhere in the community. We find that professional programmers are able to use Meta for com-plex tasks (creating new Meta functions that, for example, cross-validate a logistic regression), and that Meta is able to find 44 optimizations (for a 1.45 times average speedup) and 5 bug fixes across the crowd.},

	abstract = {Research has long shown that spreadsheet developers are 96\% to 99\% accurate when they enter information into spreadsheet cells. For large spreadsheets, unfortunately, a cell error rate of 1\% to 6\% will almost certainly lead to incorrect results. Can cell error rates (CERs) really be this high? General human error research has shown that when humans do simple but nontrivial cognitive tasks, they inevitably have comparable error rates. The problem is that human cognitive mechanisms have evolved to "gamble" in a way that will be correct nearly all of the time but that will fail a few percent of the time. Furthermore, our brain hides its inaccuracy from us, leaving us to believe strongly in the correctness of our work despite the presence of errors. This paper looks at cognitive science aspects of spreadsheet error commission. A subsequent paper will look at spreadsheet error detection.},

	abstract = {HTML5 applications normally have a large set of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules for data display. Each CSS rule consists of a node selector (given in an XPath-like query language) and a declaration block (assigning values to selected nodes' display attributes). As web applications evolve, maintaining CSS files can easily become problematic. Some CSS rules will be replaced by new ones, but these obsolete (hence redundant) CSS rules often remain in the applications. Not only does this "bloat" the applications, but it also significantly increases web browsers' processing time. Most works on detecting redundant CSS rules in HTML5 applications do not consider the dynamic behaviors of HTML5 (specified in JavaScript); in fact, the only proposed method that takes these into account is dynamic analysis (a.k.a. testing), which cannot soundly prove redundancy of CSS rules. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction of HTML5 applications based on monotonic tree-rewriting and study its "redundancy problem". We establish the precise complexity of the problem and various subproblems of practical importance (ranging from P to EXP). In particular, our algorithm relies on an efficient reduction to an analysis of symbolic pushdown systems (for which highly optimised solvers are available), which yields a fast method for checking redundancy in practice. We implemented our algorithm and demonstrated its efficacy in detecting redundant CSS rules in HTML5 applications.},

From left-to-right: layered line chart combining raw and average values, dual-axis layered bar and line chart, brushing and linking in a scatterplot matrix, layered cross-filtering, and an interactive index chart. Abstract—We present Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar that enables rapid specification of interactive data visualizations. Vega-Lite combines a traditional grammar of graphics, providing visual encoding rules and a composition algebra for layered and multi-view displays, with a novel grammar of interaction. Users specify interactive semantics by composing selections. In Vega-Lite, a selection is an abstraction that defines input event processing, points of interest, and a predicate function for inclusion testing. Selections parameterize visual encodings by serving as input data, defining scale extents, or by driving conditional logic. The Vega-Lite compiler automatically synthesizes requisite data flow and event handling logic, which users can override for further customization. In contrast to existing reactive specifications, Vega-Lite selections decompose an interaction design into concise, enumerable semantic units. We evaluate Vega-Lite through a range of examples, demonstrating succinct specification of both customized interaction methods and common techniques such as panning, zooming, and linked selection.},

Specifications are Alloy-like, written in first-order relational logic with transitive closure, and the imperative language is Java. By being able to mix imperative code with executable declarative specifications, the user can easily express constraint problems in place, i.e., in terms of the existing data structures and objects on the heap. After a solution is found, the heap is updated to reflect the solution, so the user can continue to manipulate the program heap in the usual imperative way. We show that this approach is not only convenient, but, for certain problems can also outperform a standard imperative implementation. We also present an optimization technique that allowed us to run our tool on heaps with almost 2000 objects.},

Therefore, we propose Endev, a declarative framework for prototyping applications that use cloud data storage or web service data. By not needing to write any JavaScript code or set up any servers, Endev provides a low learning threshold.

The advantages of designs based on this style over designs based on the Observer design pattern have been studied for a long time. Over the years, researchers have enriched reactive languages with more powerful abstractions, embedded these abstractions into mainstream languages – including object-oriented languages – and applied reactive programming to several domains, like GUIs, animations, Web applications, robotics, and sensor networks. However, an important assumption behind this line of research – that, beside other advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible – has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the design and the results of the first empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehensibility compared to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Results confirm the conjecture that comprehensibility is enhanced by reactive programming. In the experiment, the reactive programming group significantly outperforms the other group.},

This paper presents the first visual query system to meet all three requirements in a single design. By directly manipulating nested relational results, and using spreadsheet idioms such as formulas and filters, the user can express a relationally complete set of query operators plus calculation, aggregation, outer joins, sorting, and nesting, while always remaining able to track and modify the state of the complete query. Our prototype gives the user an experience of responsive, incremental query building while pushing all actual query processing to the database layer. We evaluate our system with formative and controlled user studies on 28 spreadsheet users; the controlled study shows our system significantly outper- forming Microsoft Access on the System Usability Scale.},

We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We evaluated Mavo with 20 users who marked up static designs-some provided by us, some their own creation- to transform them into fully functional web applications.

This web-based study uses a distributed design to collect a small number of names from a large number of observers. The responses are neither limited to nor restricted from being monolexical. The focal color analysis is then based on statistical analysis of monolexcially named colors. This paper presents the methodology and infrastructure, as well as considerations for data analysis. Finally, preliminary results of the experiment are results are considered. The data from over 700 participants results in CIELAB hues and lightnesses for the basic colors that agree with previous investigations as well as those investigations agree with each other.},

We then present a series of applications that demonstrate how color naming models can enhance graphical interfaces: a color dictionary \& thesaurus, name-based pixel selection methods for image editing, and evaluation aids for color palette design.

	abstract = {The extraction of high-level color descriptors is an increasingly important problem, as these descriptions often provide links to image content. When combined with image segmentation, color naming can be used to select objects by color, describe the appearance of the image, and generate semantic annotations. This paper presents a computational model for color categorization and naming and extraction of color composition. In this paper, we start from the National Bureau of Standards' recommendation for color names, and through subjective experiments, we develop our color vocabulary and syntax. To assign a color name from the vocabulary to an arbitrary input color, we then design a perceptually based color-naming metric. The proposed algorithm follows relevant neurophysiological findings and studies on human color categorization. Finally, we extend the algorithm and develop a scheme for extracting the color composition of a complex image. According to our results, the proposed method identifies known color regions in different color spaces accurately, the color names assigned to randomly selected colors agree with human judgments, and the description of the color composition of complex scenes is consistent with human observations. © 2005 IEEE.},

Effective ramps use colors that are sufficiently discriminable, align well with the data, and are aesthetically pleasing. Designers rely on years of experience to create high-quality color ramps. However, it is challenging for novice visualization developers that lack this experience to craft effective ramps as most guidelines for constructing ramps are loosely defined qualitative heuristics that are often difficult to apply. Our goal is to enable visualization developers to readily create effective color encodings using a single seed color. We do this using an algorithmic approach that models designer practices by analyzing patterns in the structure of designer-crafted color ramps. We construct these models from a corpus of 222 expert-designed color ramps, and use the results to automatically generate ramps that mimic designer practices. We evaluate our approach through an empirical study comparing the outputs of our approach with designer-crafted color ramps. Our models produce ramps that support accurate and aesthetically pleasing visualizations at least as well as designer ramps and that outperform conventional mathematical approaches.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the Web from a content platform into an application platform has raised many new issues for developers. One of the most significant is that we are now developing distributed applications, in the specific context of the underlying Web technologies. In particular, one should be able to compute some parts of the page either on server or client sides, depending on the needs of developers, and preferably in the same language, with the same functions. This paper deals with the particular problem of user inter- face generation in this client-server setting. Many widget libraries for browsers are fully written in JavaScript and do not allow to generate the interface on server side, making more difficult the indexing of pages by search engines. We propose a solution that makes possible to generate widgets either on client side or on server side in a very flexible way. It is implemented in the Ocsigen framework.},

We present a mixed-methods study aimed at identifying the steps, considerations, and challenges involved in operationalizing hypotheses into statistical models, a process we refer to as hypothesis formalization. In a formative content analysis of research papers, we find that researchers highlight decomposing a hypothesis into sub-hypotheses, selecting proxy variables, and formulating statistical models based on data collection design as key steps. In a lab study, we find that analysts fixated on implementation and shaped their analysis to fit familiar approaches, even if sub-optimal. In an analysis of software tools, we find that tools provide inconsistent, low-level abstractions that may limit the statistical models analysts use to formalize hypotheses. Based on these observations, we characterize hypothesis formalization as a dual-search process balancing conceptual and statistical considerations constrained by data and computation, and discuss implications for future tools.},

Therefore, we propose Endev, a declarative framework for prototyping applications that use cloud data storage or web service data. By not needing to write any JavaScript code or set up any servers, Endev provides a low learning threshold. We show that Endev is perceived useful and easy to use through a study with 15 developers.},

We first conducted a literature review to identify potential factors influencing the use of self-logged data in clinical settings. This informed the design of our experiment, in which we applied a vignette-based role-play approach with general practitioners and hospital specialists in the US and UK, to elicit reflections on and insights about using patient self-logged data. Our analysis reveals multiple opportunities for the use of self-logged data in the differential diagnosis workflow, identifying capture, representational, and interpretational challenges that are potentially preventing self-logged data from being effectively interpreted and applied by clinicians to derive a patient's prognosis and plan of care.},

We investigate the interplay of technology, data and the experience of self during the adoption and use of wearable technology as a pre-commitment device. The empirical focus lies on two self-Tracking devices, which track moving and sleeping activities on a daily basis. 42 interviews were conducted with users of self-Tracking devices. The findings suggest that self-Tracking activity through wearable technology does not necessarily lead to behavioural change, but predominately works as a re-focusing device. In this light, the user experiences tensions between rational and emotional behaviours when reflecting on personal data. The results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of adoption of the emerging wearable technology in daily life and how users deal with the personal data by developing coping tactics, such as disregard, procrastination, selective attribution and neglect.},

Concretely, we look at which social media features are predictive of physical sta-Tus, such as body weight at the individual level, and activity patterns at the population level. We show that it is possi-ble to predict an individual's weight using their online social behaviors, such as their self-description and tweets.

We argue that the widespread idea that what draws self-trackers to numerical data is its perceived power of truth and objectivity—a so-called “data fetishism”—is limiting. Using an ethnographic approach, we describe three ways in which self-trackers attribute meaning to their data-gathering practices which escape this data fetishist critique: self-tracking as a practice of mindfulness, as a means of resistance against social norms, and as a communicative and narrative aid. In light of this active engagement with data, we suggest that it makes more sense to view these practitioners as “quantifying selves.” We also suggest that such fine-grained accounts of the appeal that data can have, beyond its allure of objectivity, are necessary if we are to achieve a fuller understanding of Big Data culture.},

Use of the device directly impacted upon parents' knowledge production and anxiety, and influenced the perceived physicality and social factors of parenting.

As the Homebrew Computer Club’s hobbyist experimentations paved the way for the personal computing revolution, the Quantified Self community offers a glimpse of what engagement with personal data in our everyday lives might soon look like. Through ethnographically-informed interviews and participant observations, this research explores how self- trackers derive personal meaning from personal data. I present a lifecycle of personal data use: from deciding what to track, through collection, analysis, and future uses. I explain how current barriers to use expose the need for revised policies to support individuals’ personal interest in the use of their data. By analyzing the metaphors individuals use to explain their personal uses of data, I put Quantified Self tracking practices in historical context and illuminate the novel affordances that self-knowledge through data provides. I argue the QS community offers ways of framing and engaging with personal data in our everyday lives that can help society at large begin to understand our roles as data selves in a Big Data world.},

	abstract = {In this manuscript, we propose, analyze, and discuss a possible new principle behind traditional cuisine: the Food-bridging hypothesis and its comparison with the food-pairing hypothesis using the same dataset and graphical models employed in the food-pairing study by Ahn et al. (2011). The Food-bridging hypothesis assumes that if two ingredients do not share a strong molecular or empirical affinity, they may become affine through a chain of pairwise affinities. That is, in a graphical model as employed by Ahn et al., a chain represents a path that joints the two ingredients, the shortest path represents the strongest pairwise chain of affinities between the two ingredients. Food-pairing and Food-bridging are different hypotheses that may describe possible mechanisms behind the recipes of traditional cuisines. Food-pairing intensifies flavor by mixing ingredients in a recipe with similar chemical compounds, and food-bridging smoothes contrast between ingredients. Both food-pairing and food-bridging are observed in traditional cuisines, as shown in this work. We observed four classes of cuisines according to food-pairing and food-bridging: (1) East Asian cuisines, at one extreme, tend to avoid food-pairing as well as food-bridging; and (4) Latin American cuisines, at the other extreme, follow both principles. For the two middle classes: (2) Southeastern Asian cuisines, avoid food-pairing and follow food-bridging; and (3) Western cuisines, follow food-pairing and avoid food-bridging.},

We present RecipeScape, an interactive system for browsing and analyzing the hundreds of recipes of a single dish available online. We also introduce a computational pipeline that extracts cooking processes from recipe text and calculates a procedural similarity between them. To evaluate how RecipeScape supports culinary analysis at scale, we conducted a user study with cooking professionals and culinary students with 500 recipes for two different dishes. Results show that RecipeScape clusters recipes into distinct approaches, and captures notable usage patterns of ingredients and cooking actions.},

It is, however, challenging to precisely match the narration to the video when using existing video players. We introduce DemoWiz, a video presentation system that provides an increased awareness of upcoming actions through glanceable visualizations. DemoWiz supports better control of timing by overlaying visual cues and enabling lightweight editing. A user study shows that our design significantly improves the presenters' perceived ease of narration and timing compared to a system without visualizations that was similar to a standard playback control. Furthermore, nine (out of ten) participants preferred DemoWiz over the standard playback control with the last expressing no preference.},

Today, these tutorials are published in two dominant forms: static tutorials composed of images and text that are easy to scan, but cannot effectively describe dynamic interactions; and video tutorials that show all manipulations in detail, but are hard to navigate. We hypothesize that a mixed tutorial with static instructions and per-step videos can combine the benefits of both formats. We describe a comparative study of static, video, and mixed image manipulation tutorials with 12 participants and distill design guidelines for mixed tutorials. We present MixT, a system that automatically generates step-by-step mixed media tutorials from user demonstrations. MixT segments screencapture video into steps using logs of application commands and input events, applies video compositing techniques to focus on salient information, and highlights interactions through mouse trails. Informal evaluation suggests that automatically generated mixed media tutorials were as effective in helping users complete tasks as tutorials that were created manually. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems.},

In this work, we aim to gain insights from these "extreme users," who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor.

Despite the vast number of available tools, however, it is still challenging for self-trackers to find apps that suit their unique tracking needs, preferences, and commitments. Furthermore, people are bounded by the tracking tools' initial design because it is difficult to modify, extend, or mash up existing tools. In this paper, we present OmniTrack, a mobile self-tracking system, which enables self-trackers to construct their own trackers and customize tracking items to meet their individual tracking needs. To inform the OmniTrack design, we first conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 12) and analyzed existing mobile tracking apps (N = 62). We then designed and developed OmniTrack as an Android mobile app, leveraging a semi-automated tracking approach that combines manual and automated tracking methods. We evaluated OmniTrack through a usability study (N = 10) and improved its interfaces based on the feedback. Finally, we conducted a 3-week deployment study (N = 21) to assess if people can capitalize on OmniTrack's flexible and customizable design to meet their tracking needs. From the study, we showed how participants used OmniTrack to create, revise, and appropriate trackers-ranging from a simple mood tracker to a sophisticated daily activity tracker. We discuss how OmniTrack positively influences and supports self-trackers' tracking practices over time, and how to further improve OmniTrack by providing more appropriate visualizations and sharable templates, incorporating external contexts, and supporting researchers' unique data collection needs.},

	url = {http://quantifiedself.com},
	abstract = {Self-monitoring for health behavior change is an important practice across numerous domains, including diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress. Studies have shown that self-monitoring can enable greater awareness of behaviors and create reac-tive effects, yielding positive, therapeutic behavior changes. 1 Although self-monitoring has been used successfully for behavior change interventions (see the "Related Work" sidebar), it has high data capture burdens-with both paper and electronic tools-hindering people from adopting long-term self-monitoring practices. 2 For example, food tracking can help achieve positive behavior change for weight loss and other food-related issues, but the high burdens of such tracking limit its effectiveness. 3 To counter high data capture burdens, an increasing number of research and consumer applications employ sensing for automated data collection to support self-monitoring. These sensing applications are often deployed via mobile phones, wearable devices, or systems embedded in the home. One of the goals for these automated systems is to lower the capture burdens so that a person can achieve the benefits of self-monitoring without the time and difficulty of manual data capture. Although this approach seems intuitive, little evidence shows that automated health activity tracking leads to behavior change. 4 We suspect that this is partially because the complete automation of data collection significantly reduces the awareness, accountability, and involvement achieved compared to when a person actively engages in manual tracking. 5 To better achieve the benefits of self-monitoring , we argue that designers need to find the right balance between manual and automated tracking, combining each of their benefits while minimizing their associated limitations. In the following, we define and characterize semi-automated tracking, examine three related design considerations, and provide examples of semi-automated tracking applications in the domains of sleep, mood, and food tracking to demonstrate strategies we developed. We define a semi-automated tracking approach as any combination of manual and automated tracking approaches. Semi-automated tracking therefore encompasses a broad spectrum of designs between the extremes of fully manual or fully automated tracking (see Figure 1). Semi-automated tracking combines both manual and automated data collection methods. The approach aims to lower the capture burdens, collect data that is typically difficult to track automatically, and promote awareness to help people achieve their self-monitoring goals.

During the co-design sessions, dietitians created representative patient personas and designed food trackers for each persona. We found a wide range of potential tracking items such as food, reflection, symptom, activity, and physical state. Depending on patients’ dietary problems and dietitians’ practice, the necessity and importance of these tracking items vary. We identify opportunities for patients and healthcare providers to collaborate around data tracking and sharing through customization.

	abstract = {We consider why and how women track their menstrual cycles, examining their experiences to uncover design opportunities and extend the field's understanding of personal informatics tools. To understand menstrual cycle tracking practices, we collected and analyzed data from three sources: 2,000 reviews of popular menstrual tracking apps, a survey of 687 people, and follow-up interviews with 12 survey respondents. We find that women track their menstrual cycle for varied reasons that include remembering and predicting their period as well as informing conversations with healthcare providers. Participants described six methods of tracking their menstrual cycles, including use of technology, awareness of their premenstrual physiological states, and simply remembering. Although women find apps and calendars helpful, these methods are ineffective when predictions of future menstrual cycles are inaccurate. Designs can create feelings of exclusion for gender and sexual minorities. Existing apps also generally fail to consider life stages that women experience, including young adulthood, pregnancy, and menopause. Our findings encourage expanding the field's conceptions of personal informatics. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {The tracking of developmental milestones in young children is an important public health goal for ensuring early detection and treatment for developmental delay. While numerous paper-based and web-based solutions are available for tracking milestones, many busy parents often forget to enter information on a regular basis. To help address this need, we have developed an interactive system called @BabySteps for allowing parents who use Twitter to track and respond to tweets about developmental milestones using a special hashtag syntax. Parent responses are parsed automatically and written into a central database that can be accessed via the web. We deployed @BabySteps with 14 parents over a 3-week period and found that parents were able to learn how to use the system to track their children's progress, with some using it to communicate with other parents. The study helped to identify a number of ways to improve the approach, including simplifying the hashtag syntax, allowing for private responses via direct messaging, and improving the social component. We provide a discussion of lessons learned and suggestions for the design of interactive public health systems.},

However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self-management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.},

We explore an extension to the Mavo language that enables non-programmers to author these richer data update actions. We show that it lets authors create a more powerful set of applications than they could previously, while adding little additional complexity to the authoring process. Through user evaluations, we assess how closely our data update syntax matches how novice authors would instinctively express such actions, and how well they are able to use the syntax we provided.},

	abstract = {A user interface software tool helps developers design and implement the user interface. Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers-virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the “desktop” box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interfaces on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, pagers, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall-size computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refrigerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems. Other changes we see are an increasing need for 3D and end-user customization, programming, and scripting. All of these changes will require significant support from the underlying user interface software tools. © 2000, ACM. All rights reserved.},

We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people's awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness. © 2012 ACM.},

Ideally these approaches could be unifed to integrate the user- and usage-dependent benefts found in each modality, yet these forms remain distinct. We propose parameterized declarative templates, a simple abstraction mechanism over JSON-based visualization grammars, as a foundation for multimodal visualization editors. We demonstrate how templates can facilitate organization and reuse by factoring the more than 160 charts that constitute Vega-Lite's example gallery into approximately 40 templates. We exemplify the pliability of abstracting over charting grammars by implementing-as a template-the functionality of the shelf builder Polestar (a simulacra of Tableau) and a set of templates that emulate the Google Sheets chart chooser. We show how templates support multimodal visualization editing by implementing a prototype and evaluating it through an approachability study.},

We strive to bridge this gap between sleep-tracking and sense-making through the design of SleepExplorer, a web-based tool that helps individuals understand sleep quality through multi-dimensional sleep structure and explore correlations between sleep data and contextual information. Based on a two-week field study with 12 participants, this paper offers a rich understanding on how technology can support sense-making on personal sleep data: SleepExplorer organizes a flux of sleep data into sleep structure, guides sleep-tracking activities, highlights connections between sleep and contributing factors, and supports individuals in taking actions.

Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts.

While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.},

In this paper, we propose to reduce the cost-usability gap between spreadsheets and tailor-made relational database applications by extending the spreadsheet paradigm to let the user establish relationships between rows in related worksheets as well as view and navigate the hierarchical cell structure that arises as a result. We present Related Worksheets, a spreadsheet-like prototype application, and evaluate it with a screencast-based user study on 36 Mechanical Turk workers.

The WYSIWYG interface gives instantaneous feedback on what users have created and allows them to run, test and continuously refine their applications.

	abstract = {This paper reports on an exploratory study which used a graphical programming environment, Scratch, to facilitate the comprehension of a scripting programming language, ActionScript. Online survey questionnaires were distributed to 34 enrolled students, in a graduate level programming course with a 70\% response rate. Findings indicated that Scratch contributed to the understanding of basic programming concepts such as event handling, sequential, and conditional statement but it was less helpful in assisting students’ understanding of more abstract concepts such as variables. This study also suggests that students’ learning style preference and proficiency with programming also make a difference in their perception of using Scratch. Educators are recommended to provide students with explicit guidance on how the different programming environments manifest similar programming ideas and concepts.},

These systems show physical activity information (e.g., step counts, energy expenditure, heart rate) which is sufficient for many self-knowledge needs, but information about the factors that affect physical activity may be needed for deeper self-reflection and increased self-knowledge. We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people's awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness.},

By interpreting the user's goal with a large language model and extracting suggestions from our dataset of 1.7 million web components, Stylette generates a palette of CSS properties and values that the user can apply to reach their goal. A comparative study (N=40) showed that Stylette lowered the learning curve, helping participants perform styling changes 35\% faster than those using developer tools. By presenting various alternatives for a single goal, the tool helped participants familiarize themselves with CSS through experimentation. Beyond CSS, our work can be expanded to help novices quickly grasp complex software or programming languages.},

Having been able to support their individual self-care intentions with Trackly, participants reported a spectrum of interrelated experiences of agency, including a sense of ownership, identity, self-awareness, mindfulness, and control.

Analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on Instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a selftracking culture of sharing and learning. We outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful selftracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice.},

We conduct a survey (N = 404) and follow-up interviews (N = 18) to better understand users' motivations for physical tracking, the challenges they face with their current practices, and their perceptions of both digital and physical tracking tools. We find that for some users, physical practices are a structured and constructive creative outlet and a form of artistic expression. While the resulting physical artifacts may not easily enable retrospective reflection over long-Term data, they preserve personal traces in a unique and tangible form that is meaningful to users. Moreover, the reflective power of physical tracking stems from the interaction with the physical materiality, the slow pace of these practices, the creative exploration they facilitate, and the associated digital disconnect. We conclude with design implications for future technologies, including ways digital tools might extend current physical practices and support richly reflective self-Tracking.},

We fnd that users are infuenced by their preconceived notions of how healthy a given behavior is, making it difcult to follow Self-E's directions and trusting its results.

Co-design can be a powerful method for exploring beyond such limits, informing design that reflects the voices and values of the designed-for population. This paper presents a case study exploring the design of a personal informatics app (LifeMosaic) by a group of 14 to 16-year-olds. LifeMosaic lets users set any focus they personally care about and track it using colours and stickers. The design was shaped through youth concerns around privacy, social support, flexibility and self-expression as well as the desire to support mental wellbeing.

We therefore examine how people approach selecting self-tracking apps and investigate how technology can better support the process. Drawing on past literature on how people select and perceive the features of commercial and research tracking tools, we surface seven attributes people consider during selection, and design a low-fidelity prototype of an app store that highlights these attributes. We then conduct semi-structured interviews with 18 participants to further investigate what people consider during selection, how people select self-tracking apps, and how surfacing tracking-related attributes could better support selection. We find that people often prioritize features related to self-tracking during selection, such as approaches to collecting and reflecting on data, and trial apps to determine whether they would suit their needs. Our results also show potential for technology surfacing how apps support tracking to reduce barriers to selection. We discuss future opportunities for improving self-tracking app selection, such as ways to enhance existing self-tracking app distribution platforms to enable people to filter and search apps by desirable features.},

We found that participants abandoned devices because they did not fit with the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected by devices were perceived to not be useful, and device maintenance became unmanageable. Participants used devices because they had developed routines and because devices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for potential benefit to them.

	abstract = {Current models of how people use personal informatics systems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do not adequately characterize the integration of self-tracking into everyday life by people with varying goals. We build upon prior work by embracing the perspective of lived informatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, integration, and reflection as components of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of tracking. We use our model to surface underexplored challenges in lived informatics, thus identifying future directions for personal informatics design and research.},

	abstract = {This article extends previous research on visual design effects in list-style open-ended questions, which ask respondents to name items of a specific category. I analyze differences in response behavior between formats that provide the respondent with one large answer box and those that provide 10 small answer boxes when asking the respondent about unaided brand awareness, controlling for demographic respondent characteristics and personal topic interest. In three experiments embedded in web surveys, respondents from a nonprobability online panel were randomly assigned to one of two question formats asking about unaided brand awareness of insurance companies (Experiment 1: n = 579), airlines (Experiment 2: n = 633), and car tires (Experiment 3: n = 604). The results indicate that respondents use cues from the answer box format of list-style open-ended questions to infer what the questionnaire designer expects from them as appropriate answers. When controlling for personal topic interest and respondent demographics, I found that the number of brands named and the time the respondents needed to give an answer to the question were significantly higher if 10 small answer boxes were presented, compared with just one large answer box in two of the studies. Additionally, respondents named more brands that were less accessible when provided with the 10 small answer boxes.},

	abstract = {Previous research reveals that the visual design of open-ended questions should match the response task so that respondents can infer the expected response format. Based on a web survey including specific probes in a list-style open-ended question format, we experimentally tested the effects of varying numbers of answer boxes on several indicators of response quality. Our results showed that using multiple small answer boxes instead of one large box had a positive impact on the number and variety of themes mentioned, as well as on the conciseness of responses to specific probes. We found no effect on the relevance of themes and the risk of item non-response. Based on our findings, we recommend using multiple small answer boxes instead of one large box to convey the expected response format and improve response quality in specific probes. This study makes a valuable contribution to the field of web probing, extends the concept of response quality in list-style open-ended questions, and provides a deeper understanding of how visual design features affect cognitive response processes in web surveys.},

Although they usually do not have any software development expertise, they intervene in safety-critical software systems. This results in high demands on end-user programming environments with respect to supporting, guiding, and supervising end users. In this paper we present a software framework which is intended to serve as a basis for developing end-user programming environments. The main parts of this framework are a domain-specific language for programming automation solutions at a high level of abstraction, different visual editors for supporting end users, an approach for checking program changes against formal specifications, a variability modeling approach for representing high-level user decisions, and an approach for setting up customized end-user environments from models.},

IoT devices, so-called smart objects, are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in “composing” their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution.},

There is a strong need for user-centered metrics for web applications, which can be used to measure progress towards key goals, and drive product decisions. In this note, we describe the HEART framework for user-centered metrics, as well as a process for mapping product goals to metrics. We include practical examples of how HEART metrics have helped product teams make decisions that are both data-driven and user-centered. The framework and process have generalized to enough of our company’s own products that we are confident that teams in other organizations will be able to reuse or adapt them. We also hope to encourage more research into metrics based on large-scale behavioral data.},

This view has become so pervasive that many of the foremost investors rarely, if ever, fund startups founded by a solo entrepreneur. Despite this belief in the superiority of teams in the startup process, little empirical evidence has been used to examine this key question. In this paper, we examine the implications of founding alone versus as a group by using a unique dataset of crowdfunded companies that together generated approximately \$358 million in total revenue. We show that companies started by solo founders survive longer than those started by teams. Further, organizations started by solo founders generate more revenue than organizations started by founder pairs, and do not perform significantly different than larger teams.  This suggests that the taken-for-granted assumption among scholars that entrepreneurship is best performed by teams should be reevaluated, with implications for theories of team performance and entrepreneurial strategy.},

More than just a single summary, our workflow produces a summary tree that enables a reader to explore distinct subtopics at multiple levels of detail based on their interests. We describe lab evaluations showing that (i) Wikum can be used more effectively than a control to quickly construct a summary tree and (ii) the summary tree is more effective than the original discussion in helping readers identify and explore the main topics.},
